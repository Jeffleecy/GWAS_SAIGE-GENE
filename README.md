## SAIGE-GENE

## Description 
 This repository includes the codes used in:
1. performing rare variant association study using the [SAIGE-GENE](https://saigegit.github.io/SAIGE-doc/) software
2. generating group files required in the SAIGE-GENE software
3. example results

## Dependencies
These codes are based on Python 3.10 and shell scripts and are executed in the Linux environment.
 
## Scripts
- SAIGE-GENE_UserManual.md:
  * a step-by-step explanation of the entire SAIGE-GENE workflow 
  * specification of input and output formats used in SAIGE-GENE
- ANNOVAR_To_GroupFile.py
  * A python script processing text files annotated from ANNOVAR and outputing group files for rare variant association study.
  * There two group files can be generated by this program: one is exon-based and the other is gene-based.
  * Time complexity of this program is O(n^2)
- Step2_Results_Exon_Based_Chr1.txt
  * The output text of SAIGE-GENE step2
- Step2_Results_Gene_Based_Chr1.txt
- GroupFile_Exon_Based_Chr1.txt
  * A sample input exon-based group file for SAIGE-GENE software
- GroupFile_Gene_Based_Chr1.txt
  * A sample input gene-based group file for SAIGE-GENE software
