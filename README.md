## SAIGE-GENE
This directory includes scripts and examples used in the SAIGE-GENE. In order to conduct rare variant association study using SAIGE-GENE, I annotated VCF files with ANNOVAR (version 2019) and transformed the annotated files with a python script. The python script and some sample results are listed in this repository. 

### Scripts 
- SAIGE-GENE_UserManual.md
  * step-by-step explanation of the entire SAIGE-GENE workflow 
  * specification of input and output formats used in SAIGE-GENE
- ANNOVAR_To_GroupFile.py
  * A python script processing text files annotated from ANNOVAR and outputing group files for rare variant association study.
  * There two group files can be generated by this program: one is exon-based and the other is gene-based.
  * Time complexity of this program is O(n^2)
- Step2_Results_Exon_Based_Chr1.txt
  * The output text of SAIGE-GENE step2
- Step2_Results_Gene_Based_Chr1.txt
- GroupFile_Exon_Based_Chr1.txt
  * A sample input exon-based group file for SAIGE-GENE software
- GroupFile_Gene_Based_Chr1.txt
  * A sample input gene-based group file for SAIGE-GENE software
